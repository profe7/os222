1. [Linux Commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtqBQ68cfJc)<br>
A video on basic linux commands, very thorough and easy to understand. Quite long though, haven't finished it myself.

2. [Operating System Concepts](https://os.ecci.ucr.ac.cr/slides/Abraham-Silberschatz-Operating-System-Concepts-10th-2018.pdf)<br>
PDF version of the book given my Mr. Rahmat, saves internal storage because you don't have to download it, you can just open it in your browser.

5. [Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption: What's the Difference?](https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption)<br>
Great refresher on the course material, visit if you forget.
